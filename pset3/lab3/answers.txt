sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Since we already know sort 2 is merge sort, sort 1 is either bubble sort or selection sort. Both are similar in that both have upperbound running time in terms of O(n^2). They
only differ in their lowerbound running time. Hence to see the diff between sort 1 and sort 3, i tested both codes on sorted files to find out the lower bound running time. Based on the time we can see that lower bound for sort 3 is roughly squared 
of that of sort1. Hence this means that sort3 is selection sort and sort1 is bubble sort as lower bound for bubble sort is omega(n) while it is omega(n^2) for selection sort. hence sort1 is bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Based on the time taken to sort the reversed10000 file, we can observe that the time taken for sort1 and sort3 are relatively the same indicating that both run on O(n^2) for the upperbound. Hence sort 1 and sort3 
are either selection sort or bubble sort. Hence by elimination and since the run time for sort2 is much lower compared to sort1 and sort3, we can conclude that sort2 is merge sort as its run time for the upperbound is O(nlogn) and 
lowerbound is Omega(nlogn)
